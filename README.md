# Voice-Controlled-Smart-Wheel-Chair-for-Disabled-Patient

This is one of my undergraduate projects that i did with my team
We developed a method to controll the wheel chair with only the patients voice commands.
Our wheel chair takes voice commands from the patients in any languge and moves accordingly.

First the wheel chair will have to be trained to the patient's voice for specific tasks.
For example:
If the patient says ---
"**Front**" ---> The wheel chair moves in the forward direction
"**Back**" ---> The wheel chair moves in the reverse direction
"**Right**" ---> The wheel chair moves towards right 
"**Left**" ---> The wheel chair moves towards left
"**Stop**" ---> The wheel chair stops

Similarly it works for any other language.

This repository contains a project report and presentation file details are there

And the demonstration video is linked below:
for the demonstration purpose we trained the command in **"Bangla"**
