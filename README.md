# Voice-Controlled-Smart-Wheel-Chair-for-Disabled-Patient

This is one of my undergraduate projects that i did with my team.
We developed a method to controll a wheel chair with only the patients voice commands.
Our wheel chair takes voice commands from the patients in **any languge** and moves accordingly.

First the wheel chair will have to be trained to the patient's voice for specific tasks.  
For example:  
If the patient says ---  
"**Front**" ---> The wheel chair moves in the forward direction  
"**Back**" ---> The wheel chair moves in the reverse direction  
"**Right**" ---> The wheel chair moves towards right   
"**Left**" ---> The wheel chair moves towards left  
"**Stop**" ---> The wheel chair stops  

**Similarly it works for any other language.**  

This repository contains a project report and presentation file details are there  

And the demonstration video is linked below:  
for the demonstration purpose we trained the commandx in both **"Bangla"** and **"English"**

**The code for this project is based on Arduino IDE. Code will be made public soon.**
